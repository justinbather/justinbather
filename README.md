### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my collection of projects I've built in the past, from C and Python to TypeScript and Rust

I have a passion for solving data structure and algorithm problems, building full-stack applications, and building command line tools.

I currently run Scaleware, a software development company. We help businesses relieve bottle necks in their model with software.

## Client software:
- The Lazarus Method: A patient success platform for the in-house natural medicine program by Dr. Ryan Lazarus
    This allowed Dr. Lazarus to scale his program since he is no longer 100% tied to patient appointments. The application
    took away a lot of the admin and check-in work require to run his program. The
    ### This allowed the program to bring on many more patients

- The Fort: A gym management solution software, modernizing how gyms run their trainer schedules, clients, and events.
    This software will enable The Fort to have a central source for doing everything, except for working out (for now..).
    ### The Fort will no longer need a full time assistant / desk clerk.


### Currently interested in Rust and making Node performant
